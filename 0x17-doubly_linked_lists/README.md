# C - Doubly linked lists
***
This directory contains code solutions that aim to help better understanding of doubly linked lists.
***
Tasks make use of the dlistint_t list in **lists.h**, and required us to create functions that:
* Print the elements of a list and return the length.
* Add a node new at the beginning.
* Add a node new at the end.
* Frees the list.
* Returns the nth node of the list.
* Returns the sum of all the data of the list.
* Inserts a new node at a given index.
* Deletes the node at index given in the list.
***
Advanced tasks required us to:
* Find the password for [crackme4](), and store the password in [100-password]().
* Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit number. Save the result in [102-result](). My solution is in [102-code_result.py]().
