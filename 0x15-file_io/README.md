# C - File I/O
We make use of system calls and functions provided by the linux kernel in order to make our programs and its processes more powerful by interacting with the environment in which the run. This project contains functions that do the following:
* Read a text file and prints it to POSIX standard output. [\[0-read_textfile.c\]](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x15-file_io/0-read_textfile.c).
* Create a file with given content. [\[1-create_file.c\]](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x15-file_io/1-create_file.c).
* Append text to the end of a file. [\[2-append_text_to_file.c\]](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x15-file_io/2-append_text_to_file.c).
There's also a program which reads the content of one file and writes in another. [\[3-cp\]](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x15-file_io/3-cp.c).
