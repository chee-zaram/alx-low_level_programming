## Search Algorithms

This project is focused on learning the basics of search algorithms, and how to optimally find data
in a given structure. The aim of the project is to:

- Learn what search algorithms are
- Learn what linear search and binary search algorithms are
- Understand when and how to use a particular search algorithm
