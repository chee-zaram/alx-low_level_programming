- Execute a function given as parameter on each element of an array. [1-](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0F-function_pointers/1-array_iterator.c).
- Search for an integer using a pointer to a comparing function passed in as argument. [2-](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0F-function_pointers/2-int_index.c).
- Performs simple arithmetic operations. [3-].
