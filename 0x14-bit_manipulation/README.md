# C - Bit manipulation
In this project, we make use of the basic bitwise operators to solve logical problems, some of which include;
* Convert a given string of a binary number into the decimal unsigned integer. [\[0-binary_to_uint\]](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x14-bit_manipulation/0-binary_to_uint.c).
* Print the binary representation of a number. [\[1-print_binary.c\]](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x14-bit_manipulation/1-print_binary.c).
* Get the bit at a specified index on a 64bit machine. [\[2-get_bit.c\]](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x14-bit_manipulation/2-get_bit.c).
* Set the bit at a specified index to *1*. [\[3-set_bit.c\]](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x14-bit_manipulation/3-set_bit.c).
* Clear the bit at a given index. [\[4-clear_bit\]](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x14-bit_manipulation/4-clear_bit.c).
* Get the number of bits to flip in one number in order to get another number. [\[5-flip_bits\]](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x14-bit_manipulation/5-flip_bits.c).
