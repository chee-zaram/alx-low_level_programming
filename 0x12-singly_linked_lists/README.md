# C - Singly linked lists
A project that promotes better understanding of how to efficiently structure data in a linear, one-directional fashion. Tasks in this project include:
* Creating a function which prints all the elements of a linked list. [0-print_list.c](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x12-singly_linked_lists/0-print_list.c).
* Creating a function which returns the number of elements in a linked list. [1-list_len.c](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x12-singly_linked_lists/1-list_len.c).
* Creating a function which adds a new node at the beginning of a linked list. [2-add_node.c](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x12-singly_linked_lists/2-add_node.c).
* Creating a function which adds a new node at the end of a linked list. [3-add_node_end.c](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x12-singly_linked_lists/3-add_node_end.c).
* Creating a function which frees or deletes nodes in a linked list. [4-free_list.c](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x12-singly_linked_lists/4-free_list.c).

Advanced tasks which are unrelated to singly linked lists include:
* Writing a function that executes before the main function. [100-first.c](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x12-singly_linked_lists/100-first.c).
* Writing a 64bit program in assembly that prints a string "Hello, Holberton", followed by a newline. [101-hello_holberton.asm](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x12-singly_linked_lists/101-hello_holberton.asm).
