# C - Dynamic libraries
***
Here are code solutions to tasks that help understanding of dynamic libraries by helping us answer the following questions:
* What are dynamic libraries?
* How are dynamic libraries used?
* How do you create a dynamic library?
* How do you use a dynamic library?
* What is the environment variable **$LD_LIBRARY_PATH**, and how is it used?
* What are the differences between static and shared libraries?
* What is the basic usage of each of the following, `nm`, `ldd`, `ldconfig`.

[libdynamic.so](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x18-dynamic_libraries/libdynamic.so) contains object files of all files in [funcs](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x18-dynamic_libraries/funcs) except [simp_calc.c](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x18-dynamic_libraries/funcs/simp_calc.c).
[100-operations.so](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x18-dynamic_libraries/100-operations.so) contains object file with functions that perform simple arithmetic operations.
