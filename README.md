# Home of Low Level Programming Projects with C
This repo will house directories which contain *.c* files (and some bash scripts) that help automate several processes using specified C-related commands or C programming language.
## C - Hello World
Contains bash scripts and *.c* files for basic C codes that print, and C-related commands for preprocessing, compiling, assembling, linking. [click here](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x00-hello_world).
## C - Variables, if, else, while
Using conditional statements and loops. [click here](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while).
## C - Functions, nested loops
Defining functions and extensively using nested loops. [click](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops).
## C - Debugging
Basics of manual debugging. [click](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x03-debugging).
## C - More functions, more nested loops
