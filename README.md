# Home of Low Level Programming Projects with C
This repo will house directories which contain *.c* files (and some bash scripts) that help automate several processes using specified C-related commands or C programming language.
## C - Hello World
Contains bash scripts and *.c* files for basic C codes that print, and C-related commands for preprocessing, compiling, assembling, linking. [click here](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x00-hello_world).
## C - Variables, if, else, while
Using conditional statements and loops. [click here](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while).
## C - Functions, nested loops
Defining functions and extensively using nested loops. [click](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops).
## C - Debugging
Basics of manual debugging. [click](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x03-debugging).
## C - More functions, more nested loops
More work with functions and nested loops. [click here](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops).
## C - Pointers, arrays, and string
Fundamentally makes use of arrays, pointers, and strings. [click here](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings).
## C - More pointers, arrays, and strings
Doing a little more advanced work with pointers, arrays, and strings. [click here](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings).
## C - Even more pointers, arrays, and strings
Working with multidimensional arrays, manipulating them with pointers. [click here](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings).
## C - Recursion
Introductory tasks on recursive functions. [click here](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x08-recursion).
## C - Static libraries
Creating and using static libraries in C. [click here](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x09-static_libraries).
## C - argc, argv
Taking commandline arguments into the main function. [click here](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x0A-argc_argv).
## C - malloc, free
Learning dynamic allocation of memory with **malloc()** and **free()**. [click](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x0B-malloc_free).
## C - More malloc, free
Writing more functions that make use of **malloc()** and **free()** to allocate and deallocate memory. We also write functions that act in the same way as **realloc()** and **calloc()**. [click](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x0C-more_malloc_free).
## C - Preprocessor
Project to help improve understanding of how the preprocessor works. [click](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x0D-preprocessor).
## C - Structures, typedef
Project to help learn proper use of **struct** and **typedef** in C. [click](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x0E-structures_typedef).
## C - Function pointers
Using pointers to functions. [click](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x0F-function_pointers).
## C - Variadic functions
Project to learn how to make my functions stretchy. [click](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x10-variadic_functions).
## C - Singly linked lists
Project to learn more advanced ways of grouping and linking data items in a one directional linear fashion. [click]().
